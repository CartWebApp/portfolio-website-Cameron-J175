                Here is the largest web based project Jennings had worked on this past year. It is a responsive website for TRION Supercars. For this project Jennings and a team of 4 (two web developers and 2 UX designers) interned for the TRION Supercars company with the goal of creating a website that TRION could possibly use in the future. His team had included a total of 20+ pages with a high-fidelity prototype of an app version of the same website. Jennings personally worked on the About me page, the accessibility settings, the collections page, the sign in page, the store and cart pages, and the maintenance schedule page. At the time of this project the other developer and Jennings had yet to learn JavaScript, despite this we decided to include it into the site to provide for a better user experience.
